Fixes:

- Fixed element dissapearing when copy key was released
- Optimized side list sort and filter to work better with thousands of items
- Fixed issue with database files being overwritten after failing to load (it will now opt to not save instead of overwriting)
- Completely overhauled data storage to reduce filesizes and load times.


[h1]New Features[/h1]

[h2]Freeplay Mode[/h2]

Freeplay mode is a new mode that allows you to input custom starting items. It also:

[list]
    [*]Uses the same AI as standard mode
    [*]Has a 1000x bump to the cap on combines
    [*]Allows for more characters and numbers in the items
[/list]

This mode costs credits to use and is a completely optional part of the game for people who are committed and want to support the game.


[h2]Daily / Weekly Mode[/h2]

These 2 new modes provide 4 items as a target with credit rewards, something to strive for when you dont know what other game to play :).

These items are divided into groups.

[list]
    [*][b]Easy:[/b] Base recipe with a depth of 2-25
    [*][b]Medium:[/b] Base / AI recipe with a depth of 2-100
    [*][b]Hard:[/b] Base / AI recipe with a depth of 100-1000
    [*][b]Random:[/b] Completely random item
[/list]
